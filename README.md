# MoodTracker
This repo is for a web application MoodTrack. 
## Inspiration: 
 I have been visiting a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year, and one of the tasks they gave me was trying to track my daily mood. How am I feeling, what happens makes me too sad or happy, and how do I feel
## Problems: 
I easily forget the tracking and I hope someone could remind me
I can’t record everything clean and integrate them, so after a few days, I can’t system remember or understand the things

## Solution: 
 Create an application that allows users to record their moods and events that happen in the life that affect them
## Functions: 
1. Mood check-in
2. Users can set reminders for checking choose once a day, twice a day, or three times a day…
3. They can also check-in randomly
4. Events memo, when users check-in, they can optically write down(dictating) the thing affect their mood, they can also add pictures or videos
