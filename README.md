# MoodTracker
This repo includes all documents and files called MoodTrack. 
MoodTrack is a web application delicated to helping people monitor their mood changing and helped they recall the experience when having therapy or relevant sessions.
## Inspiration: 
Me and some of my friends have been visiting therapists and psychiatrists for a year. One of the tasks the therapists and psychiatrists gave us was monitoring our mood especially some rapid mood swings. I need to record that moment later about How am I feeling, what happened at that time, and what was my reflection after the moment passed away. 
## Problems: 
1. I easily forget the tracking and I hope someone could remind me
2. It's difficult to record everything clean and integrate

## Solution: 
 Create an application that allows users to record their moods and events that happen in the life that affect them
## Functions: 
1. Mood check-in every day
2. Users can set reminders for specific events such as pick up medication, medication appointment...
3. Events memo, when users check-in, they can optically write down the moment that affect their mood. It can helped they to recall later.
